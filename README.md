# Project Name
## Search Application
Brief description of the project.
  The search application project appears to be a web application developed using React.js. Here's a brief overview:

**Objective:** The objective of the project is to be building a search application that allows users to search for countries based on their currency codes. Users can input a currency code (e.g., INR, EUR) into the search bar, and the application will filter and display countries that use the specified currency.

**Technologies:** The project utilizes the React.js library for building user interfaces. It may also include additional libraries or tools such as react-icons for displaying icons and potentially other npm packages for managing state, handling routing, or styling components.

**Functionality:** The application likely consists of at least two main components:

**Search Component:** Contains a search bar where users can input currency codes. This component dynamically filters and displays countries based on the entered currency code.
**Country Component:** Displays information about countries matching the search criteria. Each country is likely represented as a separate component, displaying details such as the country name, capital, currency, and currency symbol.

**Data Source:** This project is utilizing data from a JSON file named TemplateData.json, which likely contains information about various countries, including their names, capitals, currencies, and currency symbols.

**Styling:** The application's styling is managed using CSS, with styles defined either in a separate CSS file or potentially using CSS-in-JS solutions like styled-components or Emotion.

Overall, the project aims to provide a user-friendly interface for searching and retrieving information about countries based on their currency codes. It demonstrates the use of React.js for building dynamic and interactive web applications.
